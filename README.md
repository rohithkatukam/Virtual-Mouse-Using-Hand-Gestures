# Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gestures
A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a system without using an actual mouse. To the extreme it can also be called as hardware because it uses an ordinary web camera. A virtual mouse can usually be operated with multiple input devices, which may include an actual mouse or a computer keyboard.
